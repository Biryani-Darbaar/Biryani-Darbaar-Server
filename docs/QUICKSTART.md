## ðŸš€ Get Up and Running in 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Navigate to Backend Directory

```bash
cd backend
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Verify Configuration

Make sure these files exist in the **project root** (one level up):

- âœ… `serviceAccountKey.json` - Firebase credentials
- âœ… `logger.js` - Logging utility

### Step 4: Start the Server

```bash
node index.js
```

Or for development with auto-reload:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 5: Verify It's Working

Open your browser or use curl:

```bash
curl http://localhost:4200/
```

You should see:

```json
{
  "message": "Biryani Darbar API is running"
}
```

### Step 6: Test an Endpoint

```bash
curl http://localhost:4200/categories
```

const PORT = 4201; // or any available port
```

### Can't Find Logger?

Make sure `logger.js` is in the project root, not inside backend/

### Firebase Error?

Verify `serviceAccountKey.json` is in the project root with correct credentials
